This repository hosts a number of projects, all of which follow the branches/tags/trunk repository layout:

= = = = = =

"Tags" contains all historically released stable versions and current released version.
"Trunk" contains the current development build and is *usually*, but not always, stable.  Beta.
"Branches" contain all unstable development branches, usually started from trunk.  Alpha.

* Try to imagine all life as you know it stopping instantaneously and every molecule in your body exploding at the speed of light if you use those.
* Right. That's bad. Okay. All right. Important safety tip. Thanks, Egon.
